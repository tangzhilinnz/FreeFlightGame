# FreeFlightGame

Free Fight Game is a multiplayer interaction game developed with C# and Unity3D. The game features an immersive combat system, where I designed and implemented a custom attack bleeding effect to enhance gameplay realism.
The game supports online play via a lightweight C# server, which facilitates multiplayer interactions using JSON for game data packet construction.
